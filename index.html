             Today was a good day
           </p>
           <p>
            We went for this super long walk with my brother, mommy and daddy. So many new smells and everything, we saw few other dogs.
            We were wearing these cool hoodies and even harness for a bit but I just can't get used to it, I mean the harness is okay
            I guess but the leash is what scares me. Later we even had a training with this leash thing and I was just scared the whole time.
            Anyway all in all pretty cool day.

             If somebody would have told me a week a go that I would be able to <em>make</em> a website, I would not have believed them.

             Just a few days later, I came across <a href="https://getmimo.com/learn"><strong>Mimo</strong></a> and started to work on a <em>real</em> blog.
